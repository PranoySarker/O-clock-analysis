The seventh-generation Apple gets some exclusive watch faces and a full QWERTY keyboard, too.While we would like the Apple Watch to improve its 18-hour battery life, the Series 7 does benefit from faster charging. You can completely juice it up in description an hour, letting it spend less time hooked up to the new USB-C to Magnetic cord and more time with you on the go. \r\n"
